# Haskell-Code
Pieces of my code whilst I learn Haskell.  
The bits in the LYAHFGG are the exercises and lessons from Learn You A Haskell For Great Good!.
The stuff in the Project Euler folder are the pieces of code I've written for the various excercises of projecteuler.net
The Project Euler file may also contain external files which are not mine own work, but downloaded off of projecteuler.net as part
of the various exercises.
